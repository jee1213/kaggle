# Kaggle challenges
The codes present here include my Kaggle challenges. C1-C3 are the training competitions where 
the test set results are public, and also there are many kernels available from previous challengers.

The rest are challenges that are closed now. Some of the data are not available as the size of the files
are too big to be uploaded here. These project include linear / logistic regressions, application of 
various Scikit-learn algorithms to classification problems, and data manipulation.
